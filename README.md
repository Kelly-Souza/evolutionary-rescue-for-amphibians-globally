##Data
This study provides a first macroecological generalization to the approach of evolutionary rescue, by comparing the expected shift in mean temperature within the geographic range of 7193 species of amphibians worldwide, under alternative warming scenarios.

##Analyses
The folders contain files to reproduce the analyses. We calculate the expected evolutionary change (Haldanes) and compared it with theoretical models defining the maximum sustainable evolutionary rates (MSER) for each species (hald_glob_SPP.R).  There is also a file named PAM_filtered.txt, which contains the presence-absence matrix of amphibians in the world, mean_temp_future.txt, and mean_temp_present.txt,  which contains the Annual Mean Temperature (Bio1) in conditions current and futures, and sd_rg10.txt, with a vector of the standard deviation of mean temperature (Bio1; CCSM) of all amphibians species.
